The Amazon Product Analysis project in PowerBI was designed to provide comprehensive insights into product performance on the Amazon platform. This project involved integrating sales data, customer reviews, pricing trends, and inventory metrics into PowerBI to create interactive and visually engaging dashboards.

The primary goal was to enable data-driven decision-making by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Sales Trends: Monitoring revenue patterns over time.
Customer Reviews: Understanding sentiment and pinpointing areas for product improvement.
Pricing Strategies: Evaluating competitive pricing dynamics.
Inventory Management: Identifying stock-out risks and optimizing replenishment cycles.
The project outcomes included identifying high-performing products, uncovering customer behavior trends, and providing actionable insights for optimizing marketing and supply chain strategies. This analysis empowered stakeholders to make strategic decisions and improve overall business performance on the Amazon marketplace.
